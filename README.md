# Server-Rotating Federated Learning for Non-IID Classification Tasks

This repository contains a simplified demo and example code for the paper:

**"Collaborative and privacy-preserving cross-vendor united diagnostic imaging via server-rotating federated machine learning"**

The code demonstrates the implementation of the proposed SRFLM method on the PBC dataset for a classification task under non-IID settings.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Torchvision

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torchvision
```
